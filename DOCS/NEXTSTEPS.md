## üéµ MVP Definition Reminder

**From AGENTS.md:** User can open app, press play, hear demo tune; edit notes; change BPM/timeSig/bars; add tracks (<=12); pick instruments; export WAV & MIDI; ask AI for chords and apply them; save/load project JSON‚Äîall without docs.

**Current Status:** ~65% of MVP complete (complete instrument library + enhanced sequencing with musical theory)
**Target:** Working MVP in 2-3 weeks with focus on persistence and export
